            Comment:'This is an honest review after watching your tutorials of React and Hooks. I must say that the way you have exaplained the concepts, I don\'t think so anybody else in youtube have explained that well. Also, the way you have structured this course and the examples you gave has helped a lot to understand the concepts very well.  At first I just watched your videos simultaneously practising little bit of it, then I tried to make a simple project using Hooks, and again watched some concepts to understand it better. And trust me now i feel like I have understood most of it and can apply these concepts very well. I can say that a newbie who want to learn react & hooks they must  watch your videos first with little bit of practice and I can bet that s/he will be very much comfortable after it. Also, I think that you must teach some advance concepts and some good projects :) . "Thanks a bunch" !'

            Comment:'Thanks a lot brother ! I have never ever seen a tutorial like this before. The way you explained all the basic and advance concepts of react with such simple examples is remarkable. I will now make a react app and start my Journey as a react developer. Thanks again.
